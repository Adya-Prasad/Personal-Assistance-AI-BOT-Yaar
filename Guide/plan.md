A humorous, friendly bot for students and teenagers who need a virtual friend to laugh with and share thoughts for positivity and comforting. Here's how to make it a fun, simple project and keep it engaging:-
Bot Features and Ideas:
    Humorous Chat and Friendly Responses
        The bot can have a set of jokes, funny responses, and witty comebacks. When the user says something like "Tell me a joke," the bot could respond with something silly.
        Add random quirky responses for basic questions like "How are you?" or "What’s up?" so each interaction feels fresh.

    Mood Check-In
        The bot could ask how the user is feeling and respond with funny, supportive, or motivational messages based on the answer.
        You could have responses like, "Feeling stressed? Let’s take a 5-second imaginary vacation!"

    Random Fun Facts, Jokes or Trivia
        Add an option for the bot to share random fun facts, trivia, or even quotes. It could be something silly or uplifting to make the user smile.
        For example, when the user says, "Cheer me up," the bot could respond with an amusing fact or funny animal story.
        Joke - Why did the computer break up with the internet? Because it found someone better — offline!"

    Mini Games or Activities
        A simple text-based game like rock-paper-scissors or a “guess the number” game can add some interactive fun.
        You could even do a "Would you rather?" game with random questions for some laughs.

    Relaxing Exercise Suggestions
        The bot could offer a quick breathing exercise or a short mindfulness prompt to help users relax and destress.
        For example, if the user says, "I’m feeling overwhelmed," the bot could respond with: "Let’s take a deep breath together! Inhale... Exhale..."

    Compliments and Positive Affirmations
        Let the bot sprinkle in random compliments or encouraging words. It could say things like, "You’re doing great!" or "You deserve all the success coming your way!"

    Personalized Nickname for the User
        Make the bot a little more personal by letting it create a cute nickname for the user, making it feel like a unique friend.

    Quotes for Motivation
        Provide motivational quotes or affirmations, especially when the user indicates they’re feeling low or stressed. A cheerful bot voice can make it more impactful.
